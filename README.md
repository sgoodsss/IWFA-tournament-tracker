  ## Description
  This application was created specifically for my mom, who actively participates in multiple three-day fishing tournaments throughout the year. Traditionally, these tournaments have relied on paper scoresheets to calculate each participant's points. In an effort to streamline this process and make it more efficient, I decided to develop this application to simplify the scoring process for three-day fishing tournaments.
